run_analysis.R: main clean script

usage:
dcompress data to folder "UCI HAR Dataset". call the script by "Rscript run_analysis.R"

TroubleShooting:
1. make sure you have dplyr package installed. 
2. make sure the script is in the same folder of "UCI HAR Dataset", 
for example:
drwxr-xr-x   5 student           student     4096 2015-01-25 13:32 UCI HAR Dataset
-rw-r--r--   1 student           student     2146 2015-01-25 15:18 run_analysis.R
